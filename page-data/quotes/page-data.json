Everything should be built top-down, except the first time. Simplicity does not precede complexity, but follows it.<br>\n— Alan Perlis</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Entropy</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A living organism [...] feeds upon negative entropy... Thus the device by which an organism maintains itself stationary at a fairly high level of orderliness (fairly low level of entropy) really consists in continually sucking orderliness from its environment.<br>\n— Erwin Schrödinger</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Dying is very natural, staying alive is the miracle.<br>\n— Jamshid Gharajedaghi</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Risk</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore, all progress depends on the unreasonable man.<br>\n— George Bernard Shaw</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Hope is like a road in the country; there was never a road, but when many people walk on it, the road comes into existence.<br>\n— Lu Xun</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Consciousness</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Vedanta teaches that consciousness is singular, all happenings are played out in one universal consciousness and there is no multiplicity of selves.\n[...]\nQuantum physics thus [also] reveals a basic oneness of the universe.<br>\n— Erwin Schrodinger</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The question of whether computers can think is just like the question of whether submarines can swim.<br>\n— Edsger W. Dijkstra</p>\n</blockquote>","frontmatter":{"title":"Quotes","date":null,"description":"on simplicity, entropy, and others"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/hello-world/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Hello World"}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"id":"931d7a6f-ab18-56e3-8a33-c896bf96939e","previousPostId":"a1f007f9-a4d7-5772-b3af-7b3eb81312e7","nextPostId":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["2525930961","3728613372"],"slicesMap":{}}
