### Simplicity vs Complexity

> Controlling complexity is the essence of computer programming.  
> — Brian Wilson Kernighan

> Optimization hinders evolution. Everything should be built top-down, except the first time. Simplicity does not precede complexity, but follows it.  
> — Alan Perlis

### Entropy

> A living organism [...] feeds upon negative entropy... Thus the device by which an organism maintains itself stationary at a fairly high level of orderliness (fairly low level of entropy) really consists in continually sucking orderliness from its environment.  
> — Erwin Schrödinger

> Dying is very natural, staying alive is the miracle.  
> — Jamshid Gharajedaghi

### Risk

> The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore, all progress depends on the unreasonable man.  
> — George Bernard Shaw

> Hope is like a road in the country; there was never a road, but when many people walk on it, the road comes into existence.  
> — Lu Xun

### Consciousness

> Vedanta teaches that consciousness is singular, all happenings are played out in one universal consciousness and there is no multiplicity of selves.
> [...]
> Quantum physics thus [also] reveals a basic oneness of the universe.  
> — Erwin Schrodinger

> The question of whether computers can think is just like the question of whether submarines can swim.  
> — Edsger W. Dijkstra
